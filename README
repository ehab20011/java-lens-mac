# JavaLens - Packet Sniffer (Mac Instructions)

## Requirements
- Java JDK 21 or higher
  Install via Homebrew:
  brew install openjdk@21

- Maven
  Install via Homebrew:
  brew install maven

- Npcap or libpcap
  Mac users already have libpcap installed by default with macOS.
  No installation needed unless it was manually removed.

- JavaFX SDK 24.0.1
  Download JavaFX SDK 24.0.1 from:
  https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

  After downloading:
  - Extract it
  - Place the javafx-sdk-24.0.1 folder inside the project root (next to pom.xml and src/)

## How to Run

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   cd /path/to/java-lens

2. Make the run.sh script executable:
   chmod +x run.sh

3. Run the application:
   ./run.sh

This will:
- Build the project using Maven
- Copy all dependencies into /target/dependency
- Launch the JavaFX application

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a "No suitable pipeline found" error, make sure you are using JavaFX SDK matching your platform and have Java 21 installed correctly.
- If "permission denied" happens when running ./run.sh, ensure you ran chmod +x run.sh first.
